# GOES Radar Estimation via Machine Learning to Inform NWP (GREMLIN) Learning Journey

The GREMLIN Learning Journey walks users through creating a toy version of the GOES Radar Estimation via Machine Learning to Inform NWP (GREMLIN) model, developed by [Hilburn et al. (2021)](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/apme/60/1/jamc-d-20-0084.1.xml). This model creates synthetic radar  observations from geostationary satellite imagery. In this learning journey, users will explore the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs)  to create synthetic radar from satellite data.  This notebook introduces the basics of building CNNs and U-Nets ([Ronneberger et al. 2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597)) in `Python`. CNNs and U-Nets are commonly used in image-to-image translation problems in weather and climate science. 

## Learning Journey concept

A Learning Journey is a series of modules that use interactive notebook open-science technology (e.g., Jupyter notebooks). The Learning Journey concept originated with the [NOAA Center for Artificial Intelligence](https://www.noaa.gov/noaa-center-for-artificial-intelligence/noaa-center-for-artificial-intelligence) as a means by which to allow the NOAA workforce and public to interact with AI-ready datasets and AI applications. In a Learning Journey, the user can choose an appropriate path based on their familiarity with AI techniques or specific data.
