# Tropical Cyclone Rapid Intensification Learning Journey

The Tropical Cyclone Rapid Intensification Learning Journey walks users through obtaining pre-processed data from the Tropical Cyclone PRecipitation
Infrared, Microwave, and Environmental Dataset (([TC PRIMED](https://rammb-data.cira.colostate.edu/tcprimed/); Razin et al. 2023[a](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/metadata/geoportal/rest/metadata/item/gov.noaa.ncdc:C01685/html),[b](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/bams/104/11/BAMS-D-21-0052.1.xml), [Slocum et al. 2022](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/35/21/JCLI-D-22-0127.1.xml)))
and using the data to develop traditional and contemporary machine learning statistical models to predict tropical cyclone rapid intensification
(RI). The statistical models developed in this Learning Journey series are highly simplified versions of those commonly used by tropical cyclone
forecasters at the NOAA NWS National Hurricane Center and Central Pacific Hurricane Center, and the U.S. Department of Defense's Joint Typhoon
Warning Center.

## Learning Journey concept

A Learning Journey is a series of modules that use interactive notebook open-science technology (e.g., Jupyter notebooks). The Learning Journey concept originated with the [NOAA Center for Artificial Intelligence](https://www.noaa.gov/noaa-center-for-artificial-intelligence/noaa-center-for-artificial-intelligence) as a means by which to allow the NOAA workforce and public to interact with AI-ready datasets and AI applications. In a Learning Journey, the user can choose an appropriate path based on their familiarity with AI techniques or specific data.

## Tropical Cyclone Rapid Intensification Learning Journey
This set of Learning Journey notebooks is divided into the following chapters:
* [Chapter 1: Data Pre-Processing](RI_Chapter1_DataPreProcessing.ipynb)

* [Chapter 2: ML-Based RI Model](RI_Chapter2_ML.ipynb)
